Nurtured by Virginia Techâ€™s emphasis towards Ut Prosim, That I May Serve, and servant leadership, Julia has relentlessly pursued excellence in academia, research, community service, leadership, and corporate-level contributions. The 2022 Outstanding Senior for the Materials Science and Engineering Department, she demonstrates a strong passion for learning, especially with regards to advanced manufacturing, engineering communication, and cross-disciplinary projects. Such dedication has led her to pursue leadership opportunities as a National Security Institute Research Fellow, color guard captain in the Marching Virginians, multi-course teaching assistant (TA), and Vice President in Tau Beta Pi, the National Engineering Honor Society. Learning from past experiences, her mission has been to share my technical, leadership, and interpersonal skills with peers via mentorship. Not only has she demonstrated positive impact at the MSE department level, but she has also confidently shown the wide scale impact of her leadership at the College of Engineering level, university-scale, and beyond Virginia Tech. Every year of her undergraduate career has been spent nourishing a futuristic engineering mindset and fiercely fulfilling her personal motto: Always Aspire to Exceed Expectations. In her free time, Julia enjoys running Spartan races, hiking, performing, electric skateboarding, beatboxing, and learning new things. After graduation, Julia plans to pursue a PhD in mechanical engineering at Colorado School of Mines in conjunction with working as a materials engineer for Lockheed Martin Space.
