Justin Hartman is a local of south-central Pennsylvania, near the infamous Gettysburg battlefields in the “snack-food capital of the world” (think Utz chips and Snyder’s pretzels). Justin is currently a Senior in Mining Engineering, and is pursuing minors in Physics, Astronomy, and Geoscience. Justin is involved with many design teams, including NASA hosted competitions like Lunabotics, Mars Ice Challenge, and the BIG Idea Challenge. After graduation, Justin plans to continue his education researching applications for space mining. In his non-existent free time, Justin enjoys hiking and caving in the New River Valley.
